This project is based on the popular MARVEL information comics portal, where is awesome possibility to use public API to improve my portfolio with interesting React project, fetching data from outer server. First, i decided to remind myself to work with Class Components, but later i'll rewrite the project to functional components using React Hooks... here are some points that i implement and train in this project: conditional rendering of the components, Lifecycle, Errors Boundaries, pagination and as i move forward, I'll supplement this point.
